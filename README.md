# Raid Tables
This project is a addon for the [World of Warcraft](www.worldofwarcraft.com) game. This tool allows you to create multiple raid setups and handle loot assignment based on the three item categories - rare items, tier items, and general items. It's used in my own raid to handle loot more fairly for everyone. 
The intend of this addon is to make it as easy as possible to provide a more fairly way of loot assignment. Instead of using the normal roll system (or previously personal loot) that assigns loot on pure luck - thus some players can get more, others fewer items - or using a loot council to freely assign items without specific tracking, this addon allows the raid lead to track items in the three categories. This way by simply ordering the players for a given category you can use the normal roll system but prevent the imbalance created by pure roll luck.
